[Chapter 30. Boost.PropertyTree](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/boost/property_tree/)  

> The Property Tree library provides a data structure that stores an arbitrarily deeply nested tree of values,
> indexed at each level by some key. Each node of the tree stores its own value,
> plus an ordered list of its subnodes and their keys. 
> The tree allows easy access to any of its nodes by means of a path, which is a concatenation of multiple keys.  
> In addition, the library provides parsers and generators for a number of data formats
> that can be represented by such a tree, including XML, INI, and JSON.
